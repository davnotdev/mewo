# Mewo Toolkit

Yet Another Rust ECS Game Engine.
Not ready for anything yet, but hopefully, it'll be usable soon!

There are more todos sprinkled everywhere
`grep -ri --exclude=README.md --exclude-dir=target TODO .`,
but I consider those low priority.

## Development Status

Some crates are either
borked (B),
incomplete (I),
untested (T),
or excluded due to broken dependencies (D).

| Crate | Functionality | Clippy |
| --- | --- |
| `mewo_galaxy` | K | I |
| `mewo_galaxy_derive` | K | I |
| `mewo_asset` | T | I |
| `mewo_common` | K | I |
| `mewo_window` | K | I |
| `termbird` | K | I |
| `winbox` | K | I |
