## What is Mewo?

I've always wanted to create my own game engine, and this is the manifestation of those dreams.
Mewo isn't a full game engine though.
Rather, it is a fast, minimal, multithread-able Entity Component System.
(`mewo_ecs` has exactly one dependency!)

## Getting Started

See the [docs](https://docs.rs/mewo)
for a guide to pretty much everything Mewo has to offer.
