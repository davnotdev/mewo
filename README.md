# Mewo Toolkit

Yet Another Rusty Game Engine.
Not ready for anything yet, but hopefully, I'll have time during the summer.
I'm putting this up on Github in case I accidentally `rm -rf` anything like the idiot I am.

##  The important TODOs

A bit ambitious, but I want to finish these by September 3 (my birthday :D).

- [ ] Basic Rendering
- [ ] Copy Cat - Make a copy of certain components for faster reads and writes.
- [ ] Parallel Executor - The plan since the start.
- [ ] Asset Loading 

There are more todos sprinkled everywhere 
`grep -ri --exclude=README.md --exclude-dir=target TODO .`, 
but I consider those low priority.
